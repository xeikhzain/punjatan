                <h3>How is shipping calculated & shipping rates?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Shipping cost is calculated automatically on checkout, they are based on two factors: the total
                    weight of the items you selected; and the shipping destination. In some items they are actual weight
                    and in some volumetric weights are also used according to the courier rules. We send all orders from
                    our headoffice located in Karachi - PK. We use DHL or FedEx, selection of courier is dependent on
                    the availability and acceptance by courier company. Tracking numbers for all orders are sent in
                    order to be able to track and trace.</p>

                <h3>What is my order shipping time?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Usually orders are dispatch as quickly as possible. Total delivery time is the time we get the
                    information to retrieve and pack your order and finally the actual shipping time. At our end it
                    takes to
                    dispatch orders within 48 hours after receiving them, then the actual shipping time depends on the
                    destination address and courier delivery. Courier takes 4-5 days to deliver at your destination.</p>
